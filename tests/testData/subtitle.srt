1
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:48,391
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

2
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:51,272
You're going out with the guy.

3
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:52,625
There has to be something
wrong with him.

4
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,453
So does he have a hump
and a hairpiece?

5
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:59,113
Wait, does he eat chalk?

6
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:03,168
I don't want her to go through
what I did with Carl.

7
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:04,517
Okay, everybody relax.

8
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:06,522
This is not even a date.

9
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:09,256
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

10
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:10,874
Sounds like a date to me.

11
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,318
I'm in high school,
in the cafeteria..

12
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:19,547
and I realize I'm totally naked.

13
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:21,678
I've had that dream.

14
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,275
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

15
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:27,635
there.

16
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:30,506
- Instead of
- That's right!

17
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:32,363
Never had that one.

18
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:35,148
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

19
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:38,307
And it turns out it's my mother.

20
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:43,951
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

21
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:53,692
He says, "Hello,"
I want to kill myself.

22
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:56,506
You okay?

23
00:01:57,164 --> 00:01:58,745
I feel like someone pulled my
intestine out of my mouth...

24
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:03,300
and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

25
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:07,002
Carol moved her stuff out today.

26
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,646
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

27
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:18,016
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

28
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:21,550
- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.

29
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:26,323
- I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy.

30
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:27,510
No, you don't.

31
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:28,580
To hell with her. She left me!

32
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,565
And you never knew she was a lesbian.
